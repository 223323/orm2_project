TODO:
	+ client (basic sending packets)
	+ server (basic receiving packets)
	+ data queue
	+ data queue multi threaded
	+ tinycthread multi threading
	+ listen
	+ test sending packet by make_packet
	+ make simple send_packet function (auto detect source mac, source ip)
	+ checksum function (crc32)
	+ test receiving packets (pcap_loop or pcap_next)
	+ design packets for transfer
	+ validate_packet (checking whether packet is valid and can be processed) network_layers.c
		+ checksum validations
	+ try_open_device devices.c
	- implement method with only ethernet
	+ implement copying important data from alldevs( d ) to dev_context
	- show information about transfer speed and progress percentage
	+ consistent print status of all devices

main:
	+ server
	+ client

BUGS:
	+ data not received correctly
	+ program not closed on transfer complete
		possibly other thread didn't exit
		(timeout must not be 0 !!!)
	+ statistics device names gets nulled
	+ too much packet losses and disconnections
	- double free
	- wifi usb doesn't resume download

plan:
	+ device name wish list with given dmac, dip, dport
	+ when device is disconnected use sleep with loop to periodically check whether
		it can be opened
	+ shared thread context { mutex, FILE **f, ... }
	+ specific thread context
	* fix connected, disconnected philosophy
		disconnected on not getting ack
		connected on receiving ack
